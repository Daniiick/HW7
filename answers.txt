Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
With a small number of simulations the smaller the percentage distribution of winning chances. Hence, the more random is the winner.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations, making permanent top-5 with Belgium as champion.
